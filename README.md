# Python Libraries

Welcome to the Python Libraries repository! This repository serves as a collection of essential Python libraries for machine learning algorithms and data visualization.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main subfolders:

## 1. Machine Learning Algorithms
This folder contains resources and code for various machine learning algorithms using the popular Python library:

### scikit-learn: A powerful tool for machine learning and data mining tasks, including regression, classification, clustering, and model evaluation.

## 2. Visualization Tools
This folder contains resources and code for data visualization using the following Python libraries:

### Matplotlib: A versatile 2D plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
### Pandas: A powerful data analysis and manipulation library, often used for handling and cleaning data.
### Numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
### Seaborn: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
